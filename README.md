# GitHub Tips by Chingu

## The Purpose of this Repo

GitHub.com is an amazing code collaboration platform which has enabled several open source project to flourish. Contributing to projects on GitHub for those new to the platform, however, can be both intimidating and confusing. This repo aims to provide some clarity on the features and workflows of GitHub.

## The Chingu Organization

[Chingu](https://tropicalchancer.github.io/projectus/) is a self-organizing coding bootcamp community and innovative collaboration project. It's also a GitHub organization! The reasons for this organization's existence include the following:

1. Provide Chingu members with a safe place to practice and participate in code collaboration workflows
2. Deliver visibility to all Chingu members on what their peers are working on and have accomplished
3. Curate a refined selection of resources to support Chingu members in achieving their learning and career goals


## Working with Organizations

Note: Much of this is distilled from the [information provided here](https://help.github.com/categories/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/)

### Organization and Roles

We started by creating an organization for. All members who requested access were added with the **Member** role. With the **Member** role, you can:

1. Create repos
1. Create teams and be made a team maintainer
1. See all members and teams
1. Create or delete project board and edit description 

There is also a **Owner** role who can invite and delete members, add billing information and delete the organization.

### Teams and Organization Repos

#### Organization Repos 

As mentioned previously all team members have the ability to create organization repos. They then have the ability to change permissions on that [repo for different users](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/#changing-repository-settings]) so that specific people can collaborate.

To better organize permissions on a repo there are **Teams**.

#### Teams

Any organization member can create a team. To do so, click on the **Teams** tab then click **New**. 

After creation, you will be taken to the team page. Here you can add members by clicking the **Add a member** button then search by username, full name, or email. Click on the user to add them. You will be prompted for your password before continuing.

If they are in the organization they will automatically added. If they are not, then an invite will be sent to them which they must accept. For more [see the docs](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-organization-members-to-a-team/).

After adding, team members can be promoted to the **Maintainer** role. Maintainers have the [following permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/#team-maintainers). 

#### Team Repos

Those with admin access to an organization repo (the creator, those granted admin access, or the organization owner) can add that repo to any team they belong to. To do so, click on the **Repositorires** tab, click **Add repository** then search for the repo and select it.

Now all members of the team will have Admin access. This access can be changed by navigating to **Settings** then **Collaborators & team** within the repo.
