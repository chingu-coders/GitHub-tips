# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds, including discussion, corrections, additions, and improvements, are welcome!

Any member of the Chingu organization can directly contribute to the repo. However, please don't directly edit the master branch (even though it's all just markdown) because we want to practice [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

1. Intend to keep changes as small as practical - i.e, don't make changes to multiple sections at once
1. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) describing the change you are making, e.g. `add-commit-amending-howto`
1. Open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) from your branch into ``master`` assigning an "editor" for review. Once we get this more mature we'll maintain a list of "editors" in a separate file. Until that point you can assign [joshmorel](https://github.com/joshmorel)

Again, this is a very new repo - so we'll be figuring this out as we go along. Contributions from non-Chingu users will also be welcome, but a fork will be required.

The vision is to eventually make this something like the [Open Guide to AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws) but for collaborating on code with Git, GitHub and the [myriad other tools](https://github.com/marketplace) which make up the workflow for distributed, open source code creation.
